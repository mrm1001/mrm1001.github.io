I am a senior AI engineer working at a publisher of academic content. If job titles is your thing, I've worn many hats in the past: data scientist, AI lead, research NLP engineer, product manager, and even CEO (of my own startup). My interests are around AI, data science and product innovation.

And the usual disclaimer: This is my personal blog, views are my own.
